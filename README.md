# Project 0

For Project 0, you will be building a RESTful API using TypeScript and Express. Associates are allowed to come up with their own API idea, but it must be approved by the trainer; suggested ideas are provided below. All project ideas must have a sufficiently complex data model (at least entities). All database tables must be normalized to 3NF. The API should expose CRUD endpoints for resources in a RESTful manner. Application data must be persisted to a SQL database.

Suggestions: 
- resource management system API
- learning management system API
- any kind of social media API
- mobile banking application API

## Features
- [ ] RESTful API (At least Level 2 of the [https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html](Richardson Maturity Model))
- [ ] Documentation (all methods have basic documentation)
- [ ] Unit testing (>= 80% coverage)
- [ ] SQL Data Persistance (all tables 3NF)
- [ ] Logging (extra)
- [ ] Authentication/Authorization (extra)

## Tech Stack
- [ ] TypeScript
- [ ] PostGreSQL
- [ ] node-postgre
- [ ] Express
- [ ] Jest
- [ ] Git SCM (on GitHub)

## Presentation
- [ ] 5 minute live demonstration of endpoint consumption using Postman
